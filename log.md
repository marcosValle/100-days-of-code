# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a project to monitor a parameter that changes online frequently. Used python3, requests, datasets and a bunch of other cool pythonic stuff. Also added a Dockerfile and a config.ini along with a .gitignore file to keep paswords secret.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am really getting into this pythonic stuff. It is so simple and effective and I cannot even imagine doing anything like it with C or even Java. About 2 hours is all I needed to make things work. Very simple but productive project.
